# 704. Binary Search (Easy)

Search `target` in a sorted ascending integer array `nums`. Return the index of the `target` if existed, otherwise return `-1`.

## Binary Search Approach

Given a range of numbers, then compare the `target` with the middle number to check whether they're equivalent. If not, narrow down the range based on the result of the comparison.  
If the `target` is greater than the middle one, the possible matched case should be greater than the middle one, thus, the range should be moved to right of the middle number.  
If the `target` is smaller than the middle one, the possible matched case should be smaller than the middle one, thus, the range should be moved to left of the middle number.
