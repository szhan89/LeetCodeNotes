# 704. Binary Search (Easy)

Search `target` in a sorted ascending integer array `nums`. Return the index of the `target` if existed, otherwise return `-1`.

## Binary Search Approach

Given a range of numbers, then compare the `target` with the middle number to check whether they're equivalent. If not, narrow down the range based on the result of the comparison then repeated the compare again with the new middle number.  
If the `target` is greater than the middle one, the possible matched case should be greater than the middle one, thus, the range should be moved to right of the middle number.  
If the `target` is smaller than the middle one, the possible matched case should be smaller than the middle one, thus, the range should be moved to left of the middle number.  

### CODE

```java
public int BinarySearch(int[] nums, int target){
    int left=0;//left end of the range
    int right=nums.length-1;//right end of the range
    //Iterate through the range
    while(left<=right)
    {
        //find the position of middle, this equation prevent overflow
        int middle=(right-left)/2+left;
        //if the middle one matched the target, return the index of the middle one
        if(nums[middle]==target)
            return middle;
        //if the target is greater than the middle one, narrow down the range to the right of the middle one by moving the left end to the middle+1.
        else if(target>nums[middle])
            left=middle+1;
        //if the target is greater than the middle one, narrow down the range to the left of the middle one by moving the right end to the middle-1.
        else
            right=middle-1;
    }
    return -1;//return -1 when no matched case.

} 
```
